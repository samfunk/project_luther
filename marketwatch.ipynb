       "   'Warsh was a Fed governor from 2006-11 who has been very critical of the central bank in recent years, often in op-eds in The Wall Street Journal. Despite this, many in the larger Fed community see Warsh as an acceptable alternative to Yellen. Stephen Cecchetti, a professor of international economics at Brandeis University, and a former top Fed staffer, said in an interview that Warsh would represent “continuity” at the central bank. Warsh “knows why the Fed did what they did” during the financial crisis, added Diane Swonk, chief economist at DS Economics.',\n",
       "   'Warsh was a lawyer by training who became an investment banker at Morgan Stanley and came to Washington with President George W. Bush. Since leaving the Fed, Warsh has been advising companies from his perch at Stanford University’s Hoover Institute.',\n",
       "   'Warsh is married to Jane Lauder, the granddaughter and heiress of Estée Lauder EL, +1.40% . Her father is Ronald Lauder, said to be a friend and an occasional adviser to the president. Warsh is 47. He was only 35 when he became a Fed governor, the youngest in history. Warsh was a member of one of Trump’s forums for business leaders that was dissolved in August.',\n",
       "   'At the Fed, Warsh became a close ally of former Fed chairman Ben Bernanke. He was often described as being Bernanke’s liaison to Wall Street. He never dissented from Bernanke’s policies, but he did warn against the second round of bond buying in November 2010 shortly after it was launched. Since then, he has said the bond buying has hurt business investment. Last year in a speech to business economists, Warsh said the Fed relied too much on academic “jiggery-pokery” in making its economic forecasts.',\n",
       "   'Tim Duy, a Fed expert at the University of Oregon, said his biggest question is how Warsh would react in a downturn. The Fed resorted to massive bond buying in 2008 to prop up the economy. “They were able to move quickly and they didn’t have an ideological bias,” Duy said. Republicans have generally believed the Fed has too much discretion, he added. And would that slow down Warsh’s response? Warsh has his fair share of critics from the left. Sam Bell, a Fed watcher, called Warsh’s service a “disaster” in a recent blog post and said Warsh looked out for big banks but not Main Street. “I think it is fair to say that Warsh is less dovish than Yellen, but...aren’t we all?” asked Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont Securities.'],\n",

The Bank of Japan shows no signs of moving away from its yield curve control policy, which commits to keeping the 10-year government bond yield TMBMKJP-10Y, -11.11% at 0.1% through asset purchases.

(Project Syndicate)— President Donald Trump has boasted that his policies will produce sustained 3% to 4% growth for many years to come. His prediction flies in the face of the judgment of many professional forecasters, including on Wall Street and at the Federal Reserve, who expect that the U.S. will be lucky to achieve even 2% growth.',\n",
       "   'But is there any chance that Trump might be right? And if he is, to what extent will his policies be responsible, and will faster growth entail grave long-term costs to the environment and income inequality? The stock market may care only about the growth rate, but most Americans should be very concerned about how growth is achieved.',\n",
       "   'Trump’s forecast for the United States’ overall economic-growth rate is hardly wild-eyed. A steady stream of economic data suggests that the annual rate has now accelerated to 2.5%, roughly splitting the difference between Trump and the experts. Moreover, employment gains have been robust during the first six months of Trump’s presidency, with more than a million jobs created, and stocks are soaring to new highs, both of which are fueling higher consumption.',\n",

       "   'Of course, growth this year is in many ways a continuation of that achieved during Barack Obama’s presidency. Altering the course of a giant ship — in this case, the U.S. economy — takes a long time, and even if Trump ever does manage to get some of his economic agenda through the Congress, the growth effects are not likely to be felt until well into 2018.',\n",
       "   'To be sure, Trump has eviscerated the Environmental Protection Agency (which has helped coal mining), softened financial oversight (great for bank stocks), and has shown little interest in anti-trust enforcement (a welcome development for tech monopolies like Amazon AMZN, +0.52% and Google GOOG, +1.01% ). But his main policy initiatives for corporate tax reform and infrastructure spending remain on the drawing board.',\n",

       "   'Perhaps the single most important decision Trump will make on the economy will be his choice of who should replace Janet Yellen as chair of the Federal Reserve Board.

By and large, the most successful bankers in recent years have been exactly the types of experts Trump seems to avoid.',\n",

Subdued wage growth in the face of a tightening labor market is unlikely to continue, and any big rise in wages will put strong upward pressure on prices (though this might not happen anytime soon, given the relentless downward pressure on wages coming from automation and globalization).',\n",

       "   'For starters, faster growth is unlikely to reverse the current trend toward inequality, and a few small, targeted presidential interventions into the actions of specific states or companies are hardly going to change that. On the contrary, there is no reason to presume that owners of capital will not continue to be the main beneficiaries. Eventually, that trend could reverse, but I wouldn’t bet on it happening just yet.',\n",
       "   'If environmental degradation and rising inequality make economic growth such a mixed blessing, is the U.S. government wrong to focus on it so much? Not entirely. Higher growth rates are particularly good for smaller businesses and startups, which in turn are a major contributor to economic mobility.',\n",
       "   'Recent low growth rates have made potential entrepreneurs far more reluctant to move across states or to change jobs, and have reduced economic mobility in general. And if the U.S. economy were to weaken substantially for a prolonged period, it could bring forward considerably the day when the U.S. no longer has significant military superiority over its rivals.',\n",

Job gains have remained solid in recent months, and the unemployment rate has stayed low. Household spending has been expanding at a moderate rate, and growth in business fixed investment has picked up in recent quarters. On a 12-month basis, overall inflation and the measure excluding food and energy prices have declined this year and are running below 2 percent. Market-based measures of inflation compensation remain low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed, on balance.',\n",

Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria have devastated many communities, inflicting severe hardship.

Consequently, the Committee continues to expect that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace, and labor market conditions will strengthen somewhat further. Higher prices for gasoline and some other items in the aftermath of the hurricanes will likely boost inflation temporarily; apart from that effect, inflation on a 12-month basis is expected to remain somewhat below 2 percent in the near term but to stabilize around the Committee’s 2 percent objective over the medium term.

The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting some further strengthening in labor market conditions and a sustained return to 2 percent inflation. In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation. This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments. The Committee will carefully monitor actual and expected inflation developments relative to its symmetric inflation goal. The Committee expects that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant gradual increases in the federal funds rate; the federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run.
